        <h2>1. Practice Regularly with Role Plays</h2>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> Gather a study partner or join a study group to practice role plays. Take turns playing the healthcare professional and the patient, ensuring that you simulate a real testing environment. Use the role-play cards provided by OET to guide your practice.</p>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Pay attention to your pacing, clarity, and how well you connect with your study partner. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will become in a speaking context.</p>

        <h2>3. Expand Your Vocabulary</h2>

        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> The goal is to speak without overthinking your responses. Allow yourself to make mistakes, as they can be valuable learning opportunities.</p>

        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> This helps you to be more engaged in the conversation, allowing for smoother interactions and a better flow of dialogue.</p>

        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> Practice incorporating strategic pauses in your speech, especially after important points or when transitioning between topics.</p>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> This not only aids comprehension but also gives you a moment to gather your thoughts, making your speech appear more composed and fluid.</p>

        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Note phrases, intonation, and conversational techniques that you can incorporate into your own speech.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Set Specific Goals</h2>
        <p><strong>How to Do It:</strong> For example, aim to practice speaking for 10 minutes every day on a particular healthcare topic, or set a goal to learn and use five new medical terms each week.</p>
        <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Track your progress and celebrate small milestones to stay motivated.</p>
